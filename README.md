This F90 program will generate a variety of line-fractals including the famous von-Koch Snowflake Curve.
However this is only as a test case. In Reality it is the prototype driver for enhancing [Danfront](https://github.com/dannyk96/danfe), an advancing front based unstructutred triangle mesh generator for finite elemeents.
