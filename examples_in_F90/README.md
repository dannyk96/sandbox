These are a set of short Fortran programs written by Daniel Kidger (daniel.kidger@gmail.com).
They were written in support of teaching the second year undergraduate programming course for Civil Enginering Students.

They all demenstate features in Fortan 90 that take it beyond the limitations of the ancient FORTRAN77 standard, including
data structures, runtime allocatable arrays, recursive functions, etc.
