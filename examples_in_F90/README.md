These are a set of short `Fortran` programs written by __Daniel Kidger__ (_daniel.kidger@gmail.com_).
They were written in support of teaching the second year undergraduate programming course for Civil Enginering Students, back in the mid 1990s

They all demenstate features in Fortan 90 that take it beyond the limitations of the ancient FORTRAN77 standard, including
_data structures_, _runtime allocatable arrays_, _recursive functions_, etc.
